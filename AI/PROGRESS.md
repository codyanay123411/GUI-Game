# Progress

## How to use this tracker

Before substantial work, review `AI/GAME_DESIGN.md`, `AI/ROADMAP.md`, `AI/PROGRESS.md`, and `AI/DECISIONS.md`. After substantial work, update this file and append meaningful changes to `AI/CHANGELOG.md`. Record significant architectural decisions in `AI/DECISIONS.md`. Do not edit `AI/GAME_DESIGN.md` unless the user explicitly requests a design change.

A task must not be marked complete until it has been verified.

## Environment setup

- [x] Cursor local agent configured
- [x] Roblox Studio MCP connected and tested
- [x] Script Sync configured and tested
- [x] Git repository initialized
- [x] `.gitignore` added
- [x] Temporary Script Sync test removed (`ServerScriptService/VibeCodingSyncTest.luau`)
- [ ] Private GitHub repository published

## Game architecture

- [x] Define GUI-first game architecture (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`)
- [x] Source-controlled folder layout created and verified on disk
- [x] Client disk path corrected to root `StarterPlayerScripts/` (duplicate `StarterPlayer/` removed; verified on disk)
- [x] Verify Script Sync folders appear in Studio (placeholder modules materialize reserved folders; bootstraps still match disk)
- [ ] Plan core screens, flows, and data ownership
- [ ] Implement initial architecture in synced Luau source (bootstraps and reserved folders verified in Studio; placeholders only)

## Project knowledge

- [x] `AI/GAME_DESIGN.md` created (structured placeholders; verified on disk)
- [x] `AI/ROADMAP.md` created (16 phases; current phase 1; verified on disk)
- [x] `.cursor/rules/project.mdc` created (always-apply operating rule; verified on disk)
- [x] Initial multiplayer game vision / design bible v0.1 written into `AI/GAME_DESIGN.md` (verified on disk; no gameplay implemented)
- [ ] Confirm a full 0.1 feature freeze beyond the political-hierarchy prototype priority
