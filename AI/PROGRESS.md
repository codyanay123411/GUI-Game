# Progress

## How to use this tracker

Before substantial work, review `AI/PROGRESS.md` and `AI/DECISIONS.md`. After substantial work, update this file and append meaningful changes to `AI/CHANGELOG.md`.

A task must not be marked complete until it has been verified.

## Environment setup

- [x] Cursor local agent configured
- [x] Roblox Studio MCP connected and tested
- [x] Script Sync configured and tested
- [x] Git repository initialized
- [x] `.gitignore` added
- [x] Temporary Script Sync test removed (`ServerScriptService/VibeCodingSyncTest.luau`)
- [ ] Private GitHub repository published

## Game architecture

- [x] Define GUI-first game architecture (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`)
- [x] Source-controlled folder layout created and verified on disk
- [x] Client disk path corrected to root `StarterPlayerScripts/` (duplicate `StarterPlayer/` removed; verified on disk)
- [x] Verify Script Sync folders appear in Studio (placeholder modules materialize reserved folders; bootstraps still match disk)
- [ ] Plan core screens, flows, and data ownership
- [ ] Implement initial architecture in synced Luau source (bootstraps and reserved folders verified in Studio; placeholders only)
